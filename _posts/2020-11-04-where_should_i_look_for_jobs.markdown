Today after finishing my Capstone project I am opening totally new page for myself. I am starting my job search and now will share most useful links for Data Science job hunt.
I’ll walk you through the pros and cons of each job search engines so you can decide which job search engines YOU should use to get the most responses.
My goal is to help you to know where to post your resume online to get the best results.

1. AngelList

AngelList is one of the largest platforms for startups that facilitates investments and recruitment. Like LinkedIn, you’ll create your own profile, fill in your information, and have access to a number of startup jobs. I found that this website is especially good if you’re looking for smaller startups (1–10 people).

2. LinkedIn
LinkedIn offers a lot — networking, LinkedIn learning, and job searching!
For me personally , LinkedIn has one of the best online job search engines.
Around 50% of jobs posted on LinkedIn offer “EasyApply” where you can submit your information with just a few clicks.
You can also customize your searches to see the exact type of jobs you want.
Unfortunately, people from a few other industries have said LinkedIn was not the best job search engine for them, so that’s why we recommend trying a few to see for yourself.

3. StackOverflow

StackOverflow is one of the biggest Q&A websites for programming and engineering. It also so happens that they have a job board! This is a great place to check not just for data scientists, but also software engineers and developers.

4. Glassdoor
Glassdoor started as a ratings/review site where employees could leave anonymous reviews for employers.
Since then, they’ve grown substantially and now offer a great salary research tool, and a job search engine that we’ve tested and definitely recommend.
You do need to register to begin searching, though.
But we feel it’s worth setting up a free account.
Glassdoor has millions of job listings that you can search for and apply to directly via their site, so it’s definitely worth the time to browse their site.

5. SimplyHired
SimplyHired has great search functionality and customization and allows you to save your specific searches as well so you can check back each week and quickly repeat your custom searches.
You can narrow employers down by all sorts of things including eco-friendly company culture, companies that promote diversity, employers that tend to hire veterans, and more.

6. LinkUp
LinkUp is a sleek, modern job search engine featuring verified, up-to-date job listings directly from employer websites. This means you’re a lot less likely to waste time applying for jobs that are already filled or on hold.
Along with their verified listings, the site offers an easy-to-use design and solid search features. You can search by job title, company name, or keyword, and you can narrow your results by city, state, or zipcode.

7. Zip Recruiter
ZipRecruiter lets you search jobs by keyword and location, and they also recently came out with a new “Get Recruited” option where they claim companies will reach out to you (after you enter your name and email address).
We haven’t had a chance to test this out yet, but in our experience, it’s rare for a recruiter to have the perfect position for you and think to reach out (since they probably have 1,000 other resumes/CVs in their computer, too).

8. Robert Half
Finally, Robert Half is another massive job search website with thousands of listings that you can filter through.
You can filter the search results by location, industry, job type, and job title.

You should really only be spending 20% of your time on job boards. The rest of your time will be spent networking, and applying directly to jobs that interest you.
This is how you get more interviews quickly. For me LinkedIn and AngelList work the best and I can spent networking instead of just applying for jobs.
Wish best of luck and hope you find this article helpful!
